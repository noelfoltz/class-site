 <p> Pink Agate’s meaning has evolved quite a bit throughout history. But if you look closely at its use over time, you’ll notice something in common. Between all of the cultures and their belief systems, Pink Agate has often been used to provide some form of protection.</p>

 <p>According to modern-day crystal practitioners, the stone’s protective energy remains. Pink Agate is the ultimate energy shield. It’s said to create a barrier around your auric field to keep you safe from negativity.</p>
