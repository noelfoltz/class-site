 <p> Spirituality and light shine through the angelic healing crystal of Selenite. Ethereal and filled to the brim with goddess healing energy, itâ€™s the perfect talisman for protecting against PMT and bringing your cycle into harmony.</p>

 <p><u>Best used for:</u> Amazingly, Selenite can be used to clear other stones by laying them on top of a Selenite slab. It also connects very strongly to the third eye and other chakras and helps to purify their energies. It's sort of an energetic master healer!</p>
